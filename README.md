# ACM Tracker

## Project Summary
ACM Tracker is a web-based application designed to facilitate the creation of teams for ACM competitions using Codeforces rankings. By fetching data from Codeforces, the system automatically evaluates participants' performance and forms optimal teams, ensuring a balanced distribution of skills and experience. This tool streamlines the team formation process, reducing manual effort and enhancing systematic team assembly.

## Objectives
- Automate the team formation process for ACM competitions.
- Ensure balanced teams based on Codeforces rankings.
- Minimize manual effort in organizing competitive programming contests.
- Provide a user-friendly interface for admins and participants.

## Features
- **User Roles**: Different roles for Admin and Participants.
- **Admin Capabilities**: Set up team forming contests, view participant rankings, and manage teams.
- **Participant Registration**: Participants can register with their Codeforces handle.
- **Automatic Team Formation**: Automatically generate teams based on performance data from Codeforces.
- **Dashboard**: View participant ranks and team compositions.

## Relation to University
The ACM Tracker project is a part of our university's initiative to enhance student participation in competitive programming. By automating the team formation process, the tool helps in better preparation and organization for ACM competitions, fostering a collaborative and competitive environment among students.

## Tools Used
- **Programming Languages**: PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Development Environment**: Visual Studio Code, XAMPP (Apache, MySQL, PHP)
- **APIs**: Codeforces API for fetching participant data
